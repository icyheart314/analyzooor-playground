TIPS:
-----
- Use quotes around file names with spaces: "my file.txt"
- Be careful with delete commands (rm, del) - they're permanent
- Use Tab completion to avoid typos
- Check what directory you're in before running commands
- Start commands with ./ if they're in current directory
- Use Ctrl+C if a command is stuck or taking too long

TROUBLESHOOTING:
---------------
- If command not found: check if software is installed
- If permission denied: you may need admin/sudo access
- If port in use: find and stop the process using that port
- If npm errors: try deleting node_modules and running npm install
- If git errors: check your repository status with git status
