1. top 10 whaleooor call biggest profit last 24h
mechanism in last 24 hour whaleooor raw data, every transaction processed we get the price at buying data then the peak price after bought, (peak price after buying - buying price)/buying price = % profit, and we rank the profit to top 10. the ranking will show token tag, token ca, transaction time, buy price, peak price, profit%, market cap

2. plot line chart number of swap every mins for 1 day with https://recharts.org/ (purpose is to see which time is most/less activity/ high traffic/low traffic)

3. token filter
details:
input: Token Contract address / token tag (blank fill)    input: time last 10m/30m/1h/2h/4h/12h/1d/3d/1w/1mo (radio button)
output: swap, unique whale, net flow, marketcap, price, price change
least priority feature (work on first output, tested, working well then proceed next) output: chart (from tradingview or dexscreener, whats best, prefer if we could add our whale cvd indicator on the chart and have line for whale avg price)

4. whale filter
details:
input: whale wallet address                               input: time last 10m/30m/1h/2h/4h/12h/1d/3d/1w/1mo
output: all token net flow on the period contract address, swap, each token netflow, market cap, price, price change

least priority feature: whale portfolio (solana on top, stables next, then coins ranked by holding), whale trade winrate

5 whaleooor filter on telegram
the user can do /menu then filter options will pop
add token, add market cap under "x"$ filter, add minimum purchase filter, add blacklist token
the bot will then filter from the api/raw-data and send to user tele when theres certain token or certain mc below intended or a purchase greater than the minimum filter. i plan to make this bot then every user can set their params on their telegram
